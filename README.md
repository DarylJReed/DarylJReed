Hello, my name is @DarylJReed.

I love solving problems, especially using technology. I prefer working n the .NET stack, but have experience with Java, C/C++ and VB. I have a strong background in relational databases, and a fair amount of experience with NoSQL as well. The majority of my career has been on ecommerce sites.
