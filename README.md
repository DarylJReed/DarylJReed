Hello, my name is @DarylJReed.

I love solving problems, especially using technology. I prefer working on the .NET stack, but have experience with Java, C/C++ and VB as well. I have a strong background in relational databases, especially Microsoft SQL Server, and a fair amount of experience with NoSQL as well, mainly on MongoDB. The majority of my career has been on ecommerce sites.
